    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools‚Äîsuch as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you‚Äôll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML‚Äîlaying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

      "### Overview of Radio Observations in Recurrent Novae\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations provide critical insights into the behavior and characteristics of recurrent novae. These observations have revealed complex processes involving the ejection of nova envelopes and interaction with surrounding material. Below are highlights from selected studies on this topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Studies and Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Review of Recurrent Novae Observations**:\n",
      "   - **Koji Mukai's Review (2014)**: This review discusses the recent multi-wavelength observations, including radio, of recurrent novae. It highlights the complexity involved in the envelope ejection process in novae like T Pyx, suggesting that our understanding is more nuanced than traditional models suggest. Mukai emphasizes that recurrent and classical novae display complex ejection dynamics that challenge textbook descriptions [Mukai, 2014](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4526).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **T Pyxidis 2011 Outburst**:\n",
      "   - **Study by Nelson et al. (2012)**: This paper presents radio observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array during the 2011 outburst of the recurrent nova T Pyxidis. The radio data show thermal emission from the nova ejecta and suggest a significantly high ejecta mass, challenging the conventional low-mass ejection understanding of recurrent novae. The late rise in radio flux also suggests slow expansion or cold initial temperatures of the emitting material [Nelson et al., 2012](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3112).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Multiwavelength Analysis of V745 Sco**:\n",
      "   - **Study by Delgado and Hernanz (2019)**: This research integrates early radio data with other wavelength observations to analyze the 2014 outburst of the recurrent nova V745 Sco. The study finds similarities with the nova RS Oph, with indications of particle acceleration and early shock evolution evident from radio and high-energy gamma-ray emissions interactions with circumstellar material [Delgado & Hernanz, 2019](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08940).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Synchrotron Emission in V3890 Sagitarii**:\n",
      "   - **Research by Nyamai et al. (2023)**: Observations of V3890 Sgr using the MeerKAT and VLA telescopes reveal radio emissions dominated by synchrotron processes. The data provide insights into the mass-loss rate from the binary system's companion star and the dynamics of ejecta interacting with its dense wind. This study enhances understanding of the potential roles of recurrent novae in supernova progenitors despite excluding V3890 Sgr as a candidate for type Ia supernova progenitor [Nyamai et al., 2023](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09116).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **X-ray and Radio in Classical and Recurrent Novae**:\n",
      "   - **Study by Orio et al. (2001)**: This work investigates X-ray and radio emissions in novae. It emphasizes the transient nature of the super-soft X-ray phases and highlights the presence of hard X-ray emissions, attributed to shocks within the nova ejecta, lasting well beyond initial outbursts. The study provides context for compared radio emissions and insights into the accretion processes during quiescence [Orio et al., 2001](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104219).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Recurrent novae radio observations reveal significant insights into the mass ejection processes, interactions with interstellar material, and underlying mechanics of these stellar explosions. Continued multi-wavelength studies promise further advancements in understanding these complex astronomical phenomena, with implications for broader astrophysical models and potential supernova progenitor identification.\n",

      "   - This study uses radio observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to analyze the 2011 outburst of T Pyx. The radio data revealed unexpected delays in the rise of radio emission, suggesting complex dynamics in the ejecta and possibly indicating very cold or slowly expanding material at the initial stages of the outburst. The estimated mass ejection was much higher than typically associated with recurrent novae [Nelson et al., 2012](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3112v2).\n",

      "3. **Early Multiwavelength Analysis of V745 Sco**\n",
      "   - V745 Sco's 2014 outburst was investigated using various wavelengths, combining radio, infrared, and X-ray data. The study aimed to understand early shock evolution and noted similarities with RS Oph in terms of particle acceleration and circumstellar interactions. Such multiwavelength analyses, including early radio data, help trace the forward shock velocity and magnetic field properties [Delgado & Hernanz, 2019](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08940v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Radio Observations of V3890 Sagitarii**\n",
      "   - Following the 2019 eruption of V3890 Sgr, radio observations were obtained using the MeerKAT and VLA telescopes. These data covered a 540-day span and revealed synchrotron emission patterns characteristic of shock interactions between the nova ejecta and a dense stellar wind. The study suggests that while V3890 Sgr hosts a massive white dwarf similar to other recurrent novae, it is not a progenitor for SN 2011fe, a type Ia supernova [Nyamai et al., 2023](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09116v1).\n",

      "5. **X-ray Emission from Classical and Recurrent Novae**\n",
      "   - Although primarily focused on X-ray emissions, this study covers the complementary role of radio observations. It establishes that most classical and recurrent novae emit hard X-rays shortly after outburst, attributed to shocks in the nova ejecta, lasting for months to years. Radio observations help complement these findings, offering a fuller picture of the nova outburst processes [Orio et al., 2001](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104219v1).\n",

      "Recurrent novae are fascinating celestial objects characterized by periodic eruptions resulting from accretion processes in binary star systems. These phenomena offer significant insight into stellar dynamics and nucleosynthesis through their explosive behavior. In particular, radio observations have emerged as a critical tool in elucidating the physical conditions surrounding these outbursts as they enable astronomers to trace the evolution of ejecta and interactions with the surrounding medium. This report summarizes recent findings and studies related to the radio observations of recurrent novae, positioning these studies within the broader context of multi-wavelength astrophysical research.\n",

      "   This review highlights multi-wavelength observations of recurrent novae, capturing data across radio, UV, and X-ray wavelengths. Mukai discusses the complex nature of envelope ejection in recurrent novae, suggesting that these events exhibit a level of intricacy that surpasses traditional models. The role of radio observations is emphasized as pivotal in understanding the nuanced interactions observed during these explosive events [Mukai, 2014](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4526v1).\n",

      "   Utilizing radio observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, this study analyzes the 2011 outburst of T Pyx. The unexpected delays in the rise of radio emissions point toward complex dynamics in the ejecta, possibly indicating the presence of cold or slowly expanding material during the initial stages of the outburst. Notably, the estimated mass ejection was significantly higher than typically associated with recurrent novae, raising important questions about our understanding of these events [Nelson et al., 2012](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3112v2).\n",

This study aimed to shed light on early shock evolution and noted similarities to RS Oph, particularly regarding particle acceleration and circumstellar interactions. Such analyses illustrate how early radio data can trace the forward shock velocity and magnetic field properties, thereby enhancing our understanding of these dynamic systems [Delgado & Hernanz, 2019](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08940v1).\n",
